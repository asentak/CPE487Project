This folder contains the starter code that we used as a starting point in developing our project. We referenced the 2025 Spring Frogger project completed by Daniel and Rae. A quick glimpse into what this code achieved is shown here: [Frogger GitHub](https://github.com/UsuarioDelNet/487FinalProject). 

Note that we only used the following 5 files as a starting point since the other files from this project weren't needed for our project
- frog.vhd
- leddec.vhd
- vga_syncProject.vhd
- vga_topProject.vhd
- frogger.xdc
